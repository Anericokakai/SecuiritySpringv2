> login with github and google 

in this project we understand the login behind 
login with github and google using our app as an authorization client which request for 
information from github and google which are our authorization servers

### 1.  configure the revelant dependecnies
in this project we shall use  some of the maven dependecies
al the dependeceis apart from the default web dependencies are listed below

```yaml
#the  following dependecies are used to set up theam leaf  so that we are able to check authenticated users 
#and return their information from the userDetails serice

	<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
    <groupId>org.thymeleaf.extras</groupId>
    <artifactId>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity6</artifactId>
    </dependency>

# the following dependecies configure the spring security and makes our app an Oauth2 client 
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
</dependency>

```


## configuration of the  yml files
we need to configure our application such that our application knows which Authorization servers they will talk to 
. As per the Spring security docs  [here is an example](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/client/client-authentication.html)
you can create an application.yml file in the root of your resources folder  add add the following properties

> after this configurations we need to understand the flow of spring security
> spring security follows a certain path which is described below
```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          okta:
            client-id: okta-client-id
            client-authentication-method: private_key_jwt
```
replace octa with github  and also replace the client id with the github client id and the  client secrete with also the github client secret
to access a github client secrete and client id  go to ``github ->settings ->developer settings -> OAuth2 `` create a github app if you dont have any and copy the client id generated by github also generate the client secrete 
>remember to store your client secrete in a secure manner 

``http://localhost:8082/login/oauth2/code/google`` your google redirect url should have the /lpgin/oauth2/code/google after your domain name you can change the domain and port depending on your aplication
